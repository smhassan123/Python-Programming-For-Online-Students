    "### Q.2 Benefits of OOP\n",
    "##### 1. It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "##### 2. Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "##### 3. It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.\n",
    "##### 4. Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects."

    "### Q.3 Difference Between Functions and Methods.\n",
    "#### 1st Difference: Python method is called on an object, unlike a function. In our example above, we call start() on the object ‘car’. Conversely, we call Python function quite generically- we don’t call it on any object. Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it.\n",
    "#### 2nd Difference: A method may alter an object’s state, but Python function usually only operates on it, and then prints something or returns a value."

    "## Q.4 Define terms:\n",
    "#### 1. Class: Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the case of an animal, we could create an Animal() class to track properties about the Animal like the name and age.\n",
    "#### 2. Object:  An object is also called an instance; therefore, the process of creating an object of a class is called instantiation. In Python, to create an object of a class we simply need to write the class name followed by opening and closing parenthesis.\n",
    "#### 3. Attribute: All classes create objects, and all objects contain characteristics called attributes (referred to as properties in the opening paragraph). Use the __init__() method to initialize (e.g., specify) an object’s initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state). This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable, which refers to the object itself (e.g., Dog).\n",
    "#### 4. Behavior: The way in which a machine or natural phenomenon works or functions."
